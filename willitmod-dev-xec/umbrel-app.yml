tagline: XEC node + solo pool
description: >-
  Run an eCash (XEC) full node and an integrated solo Stratum v1 pool (ckpool) as a single app.

  **IMPORTANT (XEC MINING RULES):** eCash enforces mandatory coinbase deductions (Miner Fund + staking rewards).
  This is NOT set by AxeXEC / WillItMod and is not configurable or removable by the app.
  Blocks without the required outputs would be invalid.
  Current policy (subject to change by protocol): 32% Miner Fund + 10% stakers = 42% total deductions.


  Features:
    - Axe-style dashboard for node sync and pool stats
    - Supports legacy and CashAddr payout addresses
    - Difficulty presets (vardiff) tuned for home miners
    - Blocks view for solved blocks, plus optional history scan
    - Support ticket submission with basic diagnostics


  Miner connection:
    - Set your payout address in the app Settings tab.
    - URL: `stratum+tcp://<your-host-ip>:4321`
    - Username: worker name (optional). `walletAddress.workername` also works, but it does not control payout.
      Example: `rig01.workername`
    - Password: anything


  Notes:
    - Payout address supports both legacy Base58 (`1...` / `3...`) and CashAddr (`ecash:q...` / `ecash:p...`).
    - Solo mining is extremely unlikely to find blocks without significant hashrate.
    - First sync can be slow on small or busy systems. SSD strongly recommended.


  Components:
    - Bitcoin ABC (eCash) full node (MIT): https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc
    - ecash-ckpool-solo (GPLv3) solo pool engine: https://github.com/WillItMod/ecash-ckpool-solo


  Status:
    - ALPHA build: expect bugs. Verify payout addresses before mining.
